## âš¡ Personal takes and fun facts

- There is no actual limitation in JS. If there is, it is usually either "you havenâ€™t figured stuff out yet" or "you havenâ€™t figured stuff out yet".
- Always put UX above anything. This sense is the only nice standing point you can get as a Front-end engineer.
- In order to make a solid system, you need a good DX for your team to start with.
- I hate SQL
